CodSoft Internship Tasks - Python Programming
Hey there! I'm Sarim, an AI undergrad student with a passion for coding, currently diving into the world of Python programming through an online internship at CodSoft. This repository is a living journal of my journey, showcasing the tasks I've tackled and the solutions I've brewed up along the way.

What's Inside?
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific task assigned by the maestros at CodSoft. You'll find my code, thoughts, and occasionally, the struggle behind each solution - all wrapped up in neat Jupyter notebooks.

Task 1: Design a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations.
Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice.
Perform the calculation and display the result.

Status: Finished! I successfully made a basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations. It is fully functional and was achieved in python.

Task 2: A password generator is a useful tool that generates strong and random passwords for users. This project aims to create a password generator application using Python, allowing users to specify the length and complexity of the password.

User Input: Prompt the user to specify the desired length of the password. 

Generate Password: Use a combination of random characters to generate a password of the specified length.

Display the Password: Print the generated password on the screen.

Status: Finished! Successfully achieved this and added additional features, giving the user more choices and more control.

Task 3: Rock, Paper, and Scissor game. The user plays against the computer in a classic game of rock paper and scissors. I also added a scoreboard and focused on making it as user-friendly as possible. Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper and paper beats rock.

Status: Finished

Task 4: To-do list using GUI. Users can add tasks, remove them, and update them in a visually creative GUI. Tkinter was used for this.
Status: Finished
